# Shiksha Arpan Platform - UI Design and Development

## Overview
 Shiksha Arpan is a well-structured platform for educational discussions, enabling users to enhance their knowledge, seek 
 help from experts, and connect with others who share similar interests. The user interface seems user-friendly, with clear navigation 
 and an inviting design.

 As part of a highly competitive web development challenge with over 1100 participants, I secured 6th place by designing and developing 
 the User Interface (UI) for two essential features of the Shiksha Arpan Platform. This project emphasized creating an intuitive, 
 visually appealing, and user-friendly experience to engage and retain users.
